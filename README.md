## Fortis 
### Code defensively, strengthen your design

>This library was created with the intention of assisting C# developers to better design their code, such that nulls, null reference exceptions and unhandled exceptions are a rare occurrence. For you as a developer to achieve this, you need to change the way you model missing data and error conditions in your code.
